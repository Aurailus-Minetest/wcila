**"What can I look at?"**
A Minetest mod that shows node names and itemstrings when you look at them. Basically a clone of the Minecraft mod WAILA.

If the Node drawtype is `normal`, `allfaces`, or `glasslike` the node will be drawn in 3D, like this:

Otherwise, a 2D Texture will be used.

Liquid nodes can be seen if you are sneaking, otherwise, they are invisible.
WCILA only depends on default, and is unlikely to cause much lag on a server, so try it out!
